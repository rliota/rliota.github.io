        <h2>Background Info</h2>
        I’ve lead the technical implementation of five single-page application clients for Teach For America
        in the past two years; the front ends for a custom ldap administration tool, a hiring fair schedule organizer,
        a candidate screening application, a teacher metric tracking application, and a corps member retention management tool.

        Prior to that, I helped deliver an automated case-clinician assignment system for the largest non-profit
        home health care service in the United States of America.

        <h3>Some Things I’ve Worked With</h3>
        JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java, Groovy, PHP, XML, MySQL, DB2, Linux, OSX, Windows, git, GitHub, Gradle, Node.js, NPM, D3,
        Backbone.js, Karma, Jasmine, Mocha, Selenium Web Driver, PhantomJS, Browserify, brfs, UglifyJS, Angular.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <h3>Teach For America</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Led multiple development process initiatives:
                <ul>
                    <li>Private in-house NPM repository to encourage better code reuse.</li>
                    <li>Use of NPM + Karma, Mocha/Jasmine + Browserify for building, testing,
                        and continuously deploying client-side resources.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Built proof of concept mobile application with Ionic(AngularJS+Hammer.js+Cordova) that talked to an elastic
                search service via kibana.
            </li>
            <li>Helped design project structure for multi-language application. (NPM and Gradle were used together to drive
                front- and back-end builds separately, bundling the assembled front end resources in the back-end project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set up front-end projects to work with automated tests in a CI suite. (Jenkins)
            </li>
            <li>
                Led small teams of 2-3 front end developers in the implementation of four separate single-page application clients:
                <ul>
                    <li>Laid foundational code (Backbone.js Routers, application boot script).</li>
                    <li>Analyzed use cases to develop accurate model for the application’s data and view layers.</li>
                    <li>Coordinated closely with back end leads to design our data integration layers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Code surgery. (Componentized the important bits of a retention management tool.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Visiting Nurse Service of New York</h3>
        <aside>August 2011 - January 2014</aside>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contributed to the design and development of a case assignment suggestion system that matches clinicians
                with patients based on various clinical, spatial, and personnel data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refactored a sql query that ran for around 13 seconds to get it to run in about 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and developed a prototype GIS interface leveraging Google Maps API and US Census Bureau .kml data
                for care delivery management. (Subsequently, there was kml data transforming via Groovy involved as well.)
            </li>

            <li>
                Designed, and analyzed the feasibility of developing, a JavaScript based drag and drop scheduling interface
                for clinical staff.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced/maintained various in-house developed applications (Java, DB2 w/ CSS, JavaScript and .jsp/JSTL in
                front), including a call tracking system and a clinical management system.
            </li>

            <li>
                Wrote a browser-error logging mechanism and service to help identify client-side issues in live, production
                web applications.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Stuff You Can See</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/rliota/JSCompile/">JSCompile</a></h3>
        <p>I wrote this JavaScript file dependency/mapper/resolver/concatenator tool before I knew what Browserify was.
            It works very well, and will even complain if it finds a circular dependency in your code.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/rliota/ScheduleGrid/">Schedule Grid</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is the Backbone widget I built for Teach For America's Hiring Fair application. It actually maps
            schedule items to a position on a table based on the time they take place.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can set it up to create schedule items, but at Teach For America, the items were generated automatically on
            the backend.
